# Classifying RGB and RC stars

In this project, we train machine learning models on asteroseismic data to distinguish red clump stars from red giant branch stars. The goal is to improve the efficiency of the classification process, making it more accessible for broader applications.


### Models Used

The following machine learning models were tested:

- Logistic Regression
- Linear Discriminant Analysis 
- K-Nearest Neighbors 
- Decision Tree Classifier 
- Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier 
- Multi-Layer Perceptron Classifier
